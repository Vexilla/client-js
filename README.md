# Vexilla Client - JS/TS

This is the JS/TS client library for Vexilla, a static file based feature flag system.

## Getting Started

To get started is easy.

### Installation

Using npm or yarn, install the package. Typescript types are shipped with it.

```sh
npm install --save @vexilla/client
```

or

```sh
yarn add @vexilla/client
```


### Setup

You will need to create a Client within your app. This optionally takes in the `customInstanceHash` for use with gradual rollout.

After creation, call `fetchFlags`. This can be chained from the constructor since it returns the client instance.

```javascript
this.client = new VexillaClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com',
  environment: process.env.ENVIRONMENT,
  customInstanceHash: userId
});
this.client.getFlags('features.json');
```


### Usage

Use the created client to check if a feature `should` be on.

```javascript
client.should(FEATURE_NAME)
```


### Full Example

```javascript
import { VexillaClient } from '@vexilla/client';

export class FeatureFlagsService {
  private client;

  constructor() {
    this.client = new VexillaClient({
      baseUrl: 'https://BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com',
      environment: process.env.ENVIRONMENT,
      customInstanceHash: userId
    });
    this.client.getFlags('features.json');
  }

  should(featureName) {
    return this.client?.should(featureName);
  }
}
```


## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags are useful for enabling or disabling parts of your application without having to redeploy. In some cases such as mobile applications, the redeploy could take up to a week.

See more about them here:

- [https://featureflags.io](https://featureflags.io)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle)

Feature Flags are also a fundamental building block for things such as A/B testing.

## How does it work?

1. You configure the Config UI with your hosting credentials. These are stored in LocalStorage. Your credentials should have a limited scope of permissions.

2. You add environments to the Config UI.

3. Then you add features. These can be a toggle or a gradual rollout.

4. Then you upload the json to your static hosting provider. You can also download ot copy the JSON to your clipboard for other uses.

5. Your applications include a client library as a dependency and the client consumes the JSON config.

6. Finally your application uses the client you created to determine if a feature `should` be on.
